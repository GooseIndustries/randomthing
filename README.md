Disclaimer

RandomThing is a tool designed to optimize your experience by providing interactive system notifications and real-time optimization alerts. While it makes use of certain system-level features, rest assured it will not harm your system in any way (but it might look like it’s doing something pretty extreme — just for fun!).
